    <h1>About</h1>
    <div class="story">
      <div class="sub-title">STORY</div>
      <p>The Corona pandemic that lasted for several years has finally come to an end. During this time, our work and
        life styles changed significantly. Remote work and home learning have become the new normal for many of us. As a
        student, I find myself learning from home most days to cut down on commute time. Between chasing deadlines and
        assignments every day, craving a break but without time to step out to a cafe, and quickly sipping my
        home-brewed espresso, it's a somewhat lonely routine.</p>
      <p>
        I started thinking, 'Wouldn't it be great if I could refresh at home as easily as I would in a cafe?' That's
        when the idea of creating a virtual cafe came to me, and thus, Baristana was born.
      </p>
      <p>
        I asked myself, 'What makes a cafe experience special?' I decided to focus on two aspects - a cozy atmosphere,
        brought to life with soothing background music, and the chance for interaction, provided by a chat function.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope remote workers out there can feel relaxed during their breaks, as if they're at an actual cafe, and enjoy
        casual chats with new people.
      </p>

      <p>The idea for Baristana was born out of my own everyday experiences. I hope you find a sense of relaxation and
